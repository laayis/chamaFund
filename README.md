ChamaFund is a mobile application that minimizes the stress which face groups of people when they decide to come together and contribute funds towards
a common goal.

## How it works

When a person downloads the app, he creates a group. Each new group has a wallet. A wallet is like the groups bank account where all the funds
are deposited for that particular group. Each group has a unique wallet.

The person who creates the group automatically becomes the group admin. Group admin can invite users to the group with an inivte code or link.
Group members make deposits to their wallet and after a specified period of time, for example 3 months, All the deposited cash is sent to one
of the group members individual wallet, where he can make withdrawals to his account.

This process repeats itself for all the members in that group. It is more of a merry go round kind of thing ;)
